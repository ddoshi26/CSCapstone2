# Projects Marketplace (CS Capstone Project)

## Synopsis

A marketplace for students/groups to find creative and challenging projects to work on. Projects will be created by industry engineers and students can create groups and pick up projects.

This was assigned as a part of a class project. We were provided some skeleton code and we implemented the below mentioned features.
